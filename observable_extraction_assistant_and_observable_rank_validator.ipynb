Andariel has a connection to the cyber-attack named Operation Black Mine that occurred in 2014 and 2015. However, Operation Black Mine is also associated with the attacks on the South Korean Military Agency in 2008 and the attacks against South Korean banks and broadcastersin 2013 (a.k.a DarkSeoul).\\n\\nThe major targets of the Andariel Group include not only military agencies, defense industries, political organizations, security companies, ICT companies, and energy research institutes, but also financial targets, such as ATMs, banks, travel agencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online qambling users.\\n\\nTheir main methods of attacks are spear phishing using macros, watering hole attacks exploiting Active-X vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploits on security and IT asset management systems, and supply chain attacks.\\n\\nThe group makes use of well-known backdoors, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT, but also uses self-developed backdoors, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor. Furthermore, this group appears to know Korean language and its IT environment.\\n\\nThis report examines the attacks by Andariel Threat Group, including key methods, and changes in their purpose and targets.\\n\\n', '# Attack Vectors (Infection Routes)\\n\\nThe Andariel group uses a variety of attack techniques, and, in particular, they take advantage of vulnerabilities of local software in South Korea.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Figure 1] Major attack vectors of the Andariel group\\n\\n', '## 1. Spear Phishing\\n\\nThe Andariel group uses the spear phishing method by understanding their target and sending emails with an attachment that appears to be from a relevant, seemingly trustworthy source. The attachments contain macro and trick the targeted recipient into activating the macro. However, this method of inducing macro activation has become more devious after 2015.\\n\\n[Figure 2] below shows the contents of attachments used in the 2015 attacks with the original method of inducing macro activation.

Watering Hole (Active-X Vulnerability)\\n\\nThe Andariel group also uses the watering hole technique, which compromise and inject exploit codes into a website. The targeted systems are infected with malware upon accessing the compromised website using a vulnerable web browser. These attacks also limit infection to specific IP address ranges, making it much more difficult to identify the attack targets.\\n\\nFor the watering hole attack, the group usually embeds an Active-X vulnerability exploit codes in the target website. When the target accesses the website via an Internet Explorer browser with a specific Active-X installed the attack proceeds. After successful exploitation of the vulnerability, a JavaScript or VBScript file is created on the user system and this file downloads the malware from a specified address.\\n\\n| function getXMLHI tpRequest() |\\n| --- |\\n| tryingturn new Act (vaXObject( Moxel 2 XMLHTTP. 6.0 ) ) |\\n| catcheal (itry(return new Active)(b) == ( \"Msxall INLHTF 5.0\") ) |\\n| catch(@2) tryireturn new ActiveXObject   Msxm)2,XMLHTP,4,0\");} |\\n| catch(eS) itryireturn new Active XOblect   Msxm12 IMLHITP.3.0 ); } |\\n| catch(e4)itry(return new ActiveXObject) Mixw12.XMLHIP ) .; |\\n| catch(e5){tryIreturn new ActiveXObject( Microsoft.

Central Management Solution\\n\\nInstitutions and companies of a certain size often manage multiple systems in their organizations, such as PCs, by connecting them to a central management solution. This central management solution is mainly responsible for Network Access Control (NAC); anti-virus management, software and hardware assets control; and patch management, and it usually provides features such as IT asset management, report generation, software distribution, and remote control.\\n\\nThe attacker identifies and analyzes the central management solution used by the target institution or company to find and exploit the vulnerability. The attacks on the central management software can be categorized into two types: management server account attacks and vulnerability attacks on agents installed in the client.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Fiqure 6] Concept diagram of the central management solution\\n\\nMost central manaqement solutions consist of a management server and a client on which the agent is installed. The management server sends batch files to the connected systems or applies policies, and remotely controls the systems. The client processes files and commands sent from the management server.\\n\\nIn the event of an attack using the manaqement server, the attacker steals the targeted administrator account and distributes malware in the place of a normal file. This is the reason for the emphasis on management of administrator accounts. Another role of the management server is to receive the security updates for commercial software from external sources (software providers) and distributes them throughout the organization. However, if a file from the external update server tampers (e.g., by hacking); an update file containing malware will be distributed throughout the company or institution via the central management server.\\n\\nThe client agent of the central management solution is responsible for receiving and executing the file transmitted from the management server. Generally, the aqent has a feature to check whether the delivered command or file is verified. To bypass this process, the attacker pretends to be the management server and sends a command to the agent.\\n\\nThe Andariel group is responsible for carrying out many attacks on central management solutions that are widely used in South Korea. The following are the cases of the group transferring malicious files exploiting the vulnerabilities of the client agent in three types of central management solution.\\n\\nThe first case is malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution A, which was first discovered in 2015. When the malware is executed, the executable file, v3pscan.exe, containing malware is transmitted to the agent of central management solution A through a specified IP address and executed.\\n\\n| .0040CE00: 26 02 00 00.00 62 00 00.0E 07 0B 00.03 00 1A 00 80 0 1.8 0 + | 0040CE10: 0E 00 25 00.34 00 70 00.58 46 49 40.45 5F 52 45 4 % 4 ) 1FILE RE |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 0040CE20: 40 4F 54 45.5F 45 58 45.43 50 00 88.46 49 4C 45 HOTE EXECTING LLF | 00400230 . 56.50 41.56.48.30 43.39.50 27.49 46.44 47.27.23 .

Various types of malware were used, such as nc.exe, nt.exe, n5lic.exe, nc5rt2.exe, and Bin.exe, to exploit the management system. Also, the attacker used a method of generating a VBScript file, such as vs 1.vbs and winrm.vbs, to download malicious files.\\n\\nVariants of this malware were discovered between 2015 and 2017, which used the server IP, target system IP, download address, remote executable path, and other items as arguments to exploit systems and generate script files that downloaded malware. The generated script downloads a file from the address entered as an argument and restores 5 bytes.\\n\\n| c: work >nc Usage:main.exe ServerIP, TargetIP, DownloadUrl, RemoteFilePath, [vbScriptPath=c: |\\n| --- |\\n| Windows temp\\\\winrm.ubsInvalid License.

            "Institutions and companies of a certain size often manage multiple systems in their organizations, such as PCs, by connecting them to a central management solution. This central management solution is mainly responsible for Network Access Control (NAC); anti-virus management, software and hardware assets control; and patch management, and it usually provides features such as IT asset management, report generation, software distribution, and remote control.\n",

            "The attacker identifies and analyzes the central management solution used by the target institution or company to find and exploit the vulnerability.

The management server sends batch files to the connected systems or applies policies, and remotely controls the systems. The client processes files and commands sent from the management server.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the event of an attack using the manaqement server, the attacker steals the targeted administrator account and distributes malware in the place of a normal file. This is the reason for the emphasis on management of administrator accounts. Another role of the management server is to receive the security updates for commercial software from external sources (software providers) and distributes them throughout the organization. However, if a file from the external update server tampers (e.g., by hacking); an update file containing malware will be distributed throughout the company or institution via the central management server.\n",
            "\n",
            "The client agent of the central management solution is responsible for receiving and executing the file transmitted from the management server. Generally, the aqent has a feature to check whether the delivered command or file is verified. To bypass this process, the attacker pretends to be the management server and sends a command to the agent.\n",
